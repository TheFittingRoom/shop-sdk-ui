You are a typescript developer working on an open-source ecmascript module that connects to firestore and a REST http server.
The API endpoint payloads are generated in src/api/gen.
The source code is deployed to github releases and served via jsdelivr.
You may use playwright or chrome-devtools for debugging.
Always include a simple lowercase console.debug statement in each function you define.
Never add line comments.
Always add function comments if the functions are complicated (more than 3 lines of code).
